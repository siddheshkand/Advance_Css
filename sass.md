## SASS FEATURES
* Variables: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc;
* Nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code;
* Operators: for mathematical operations right inside of CSS;
* Partials and imports: to write CSS in different files and importing them all into one single file;
* Mixins: to write reusable pieces of CSS code;
* Functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can than be used;
* Extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them;
* Control directives: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops (not covered in this course)
